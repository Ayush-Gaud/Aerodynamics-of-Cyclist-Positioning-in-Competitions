# Aerodynamics-of-Cyclist-Positioning-in-Competitions

A comparative aerodynamic study of cyclist postures using CFD simulations and wind tunnel testing, conducted as part of the course AE211: Incompressible Aerodynamics at IIT Kanpur. The project quantifies drag reduction across various racing positions and bicycle types, evaluating how posture optimization can enhance speed and efficiency in competitive cycling. Includes streamlined visualizations, validated results, and practical insights for performance improvement.
